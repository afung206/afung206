## About Me
A Full Stack Developer based in Seattle, Washington. I graduated from the 
University of Washington in 2011 and am currently a full-time developer at The Boeing Company.

I have a strong passion for Software Development but most importantly, code quality! 
Through the practice of Test-Driven Development (TDD), we can add strong foundation of confidence and quality into our code.

I am always on the lookout to learning and exploring new frameworks and tech stacks.

I also enjoy to solving interesting and puzzling problems through Software Development and can catch me solving random
LeeCode problems!

Currently open and looking for new opportunities in the Greater Seattle Area!
